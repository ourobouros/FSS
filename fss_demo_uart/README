1. Initialize git submodules:
git submodule init
git submodule update

2 Install libfdt and libpixman
sudo apt-get install libfdt-dev libpixman-1-dev

3 If you don't have Questasim 10.2 or it is NOT installed in /opt/EDA/mentor,
modify the QUESTA_INCLUDE_PATH variable in the fli/compile.sh file to make it
point to the directory where mti.h is

4. Invoke the program's compilation script:
./compile_all.sh

5. Start QuestaSim by typing in a terminal:
vsim -64 -do sim_start.do &

6. On two separate terminals, start the two QEmu instances with, respectively,
./start_qemu_A.sh
./start_qemu_B.sh

7. In each QEmu terminal, load the module with
modprobe 8250

8. Fire up a PicoCom terminal in each QEmu instance with
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyS0

9. Wait until PicoCom writes "Terminal ready"

10. Start typing

11. Enjoy!

-- IF YOU ALSO WANT TO PLAY WITH THE KERNEL PATCH --
(NOT necessary, the compiled kernel is already in bin/)

1. Do your changes to kernel_patch and then recompile with
./kernel_compile.sh
